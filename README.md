**Last Updated:** [2026.1.18]  
**Developer:** [pan]  
**Contact:** [pxw3504k@gmail.com]

This Privacy Policy explains how the **Lifeline SOS** mobile application (“App”) collects, uses, stores, and protects your personal information. By installing or using the App, you consent to the practices described below.

The Lifeline SOS App is designed as a personal safety tool. **We do not collect, store, transmit, or share your personal data with any external servers, cloud services, or third-party analytics platforms unless explicitly initiated by you during an emergency event.** All data remains strictly on your device unless you trigger an SOS action.

## 1. Information We Collect

The App only accesses or processes data when you actively use specific features. No background data collection occurs.

### a) Location Information
- **When collected:** Only when you manually activate the SOS function or when an automated inactivity alert is triggered **and you confirm** the emergency action.
- **Type of data:** Precise GPS coordinates (latitude/longitude).
- **Purpose:** To share your real-time location with your pre-selected emergency contacts via SMS or messaging apps.
- **Note:** The App does **not** continuously track or log your location in the background. Location access is granted only at the moment of SOS activation and is immediately released afterward.

### b) Contact Information
- **When collected:** When you add or manage emergency contacts within the App.
- **Type of data:** Names and phone numbers from your device’s address book (only those you explicitly select).
- **Purpose:** To enable one-tap calling, SMS alerts, and location sharing during emergencies.
- **Note:** The App **never reads your entire contact list automatically**. Access is limited to contacts you choose.

### c) Device & Usage Data
- The App **does not collect**:
  - Browsing history
  - App usage statistics
  - Crash logs (unless you opt into optional diagnostics)
  - Calendar events, call logs, or messages (except for sending SOS SMS, as described below)

### d) AI Contextual Analysis (Optional Feature)
- If enabled, the App may **temporarily analyze** local device data (e.g., recent calls, calendar entries) **only on-device** to generate a contextual message before placing an emergency call.
- This analysis happens **entirely on your device**—no data is sent to external servers or AI APIs.

## 2. How We Use Your Information

Your data is used **solely for emergency response purposes**:

- To send your live location to trusted contacts during an SOS event.
- To place automated calls to your emergency contacts.
- To generate context-aware alerts (if enabled) to help contacts understand your situation.
- To allow you to manage your emergency contact list locally.

**We never use your data for advertising, profiling, or commercial purposes.**

## 3. Data Storage and Security

- **All data is stored exclusively on your device** (local storage).
- No personal information (contacts, location history, settings) is uploaded to cloud servers, databases, or third-party platforms.
- Data is encrypted at rest using your device’s built-in security (e.g., Android Keystore).
- Once you uninstall the App, **all associated data is permanently deleted** from your device.

## 4. Data Sharing and Disclosure

We **do not sell, rent, or share** your personal information with any third parties—**except** in the following scenario:

### During an SOS Event (User-Initiated):
- Your **current location** may be sent via **SMS** or **messaging apps** (e.g., WhatsApp) to your pre-approved emergency contacts.
- A **phone call** may be placed directly to your emergency contacts.
- These actions are **explicitly triggered by you** (or by an automated alert **after your confirmation**).

> 🔒 **Important**: The App itself **does not have internet access** beyond what’s needed for SMS/calling. It does not integrate with social media, analytics, or advertising SDKs.

## 5. Third-Party Services

The Lifeline SOS App **does not integrate** with any third-party services such as:
- Google Analytics
- Facebook SDK
- Firebase (except possibly for optional crash reporting, which can be disabled)
- Cloud storage providers

If future updates include optional integrations (e.g., cloud backup), they will be **clearly disclosed** and require your explicit opt-in.

## 6. Your Rights

As a user, you have the following rights:

- **Access & Review**: View all emergency contacts and settings stored locally in the App.
- **Edit or Delete**: Remove any contact or disable SOS features at any time.
- **Revoke Permissions**: Disable location, SMS, phone, or contacts permissions anytime via your device settings.
- **Delete All Data**: Uninstalling the App permanently erases all data.
- **Opt Out of AI Features**: Disable contextual prompts in settings if desired.

## 7. Children’s Privacy

The App is **not intended for users under 13 years old**. We do not knowingly collect data from children.

## 8. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in the App or legal requirements. The updated policy will be posted here with a new “Last Updated” date.
